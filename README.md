# Serverless Todo Tutorial
This tutorial was created to be used alongside an in-person presentation. I'll update this readme one day with a walkthrough.

## Setup
Make sure you have [node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, then you should be able to run the following:

```
npm install -g serverless
```

Also, you will need to have the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed.
